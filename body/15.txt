*ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY*
Where a passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or a stop in a
country other than the country of departure, either the Warsaw Convention
and the Hague Protocol, their amendments, and any special contracts of
carriage embodied in applicable tariffs that waive Warsaw/Hague limits, or
the Montreal Convention may apply to the entire journey including the
portion within the countries of departure or destination and, in some
cases, may limit the liability of the carrier for death or personal injury,
delay, and for loss of or damage to baggage. The Montreal Convention, where
applicable, does not impose, and special contracts voluntarily entered into
by many carriers, including JetBlue, waive, the Warsaw/Hague limitations
for compensatory damages arising out of personal injury or wrongful death
caused by an accident, as defined by the applicable treaty. The names of
carriers party to the special contracts are available at all ticket offices
of such carriers and may be examined upon request.

*NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY LIMITS*
For international transportation (including domestic portions) governed by
the Montreal Convention, JetBlue's liability for baggage is limited to

following items in checked or unchecked baggage: money, jewelry including
watches, cameras, camcorders, any type of electronic equipment, including
computers, valuable papers or documents and other similar items as
described in more detail in the Contract of Carriage.

*NOTICE OF OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS*
Although JetBlue does not intentionally overbook its flights, there is a
slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a
person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one
will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers
willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the
airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, JetBlue will deny
boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding
priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with JetBlue's
check-in deadline (which are available upon request from JetBlue), persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and JetBlue's boarding priorities are
