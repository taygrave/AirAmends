Yeah=2C many lessons learned here.  Another one=2C not mentioned yet=2C is =
waiting for Nick.  We have to try to set ourselves up as much as possible i=
n a way that leaves us not dependent on him.  If we had known for sure that=
 he was coming at Xmas=2C then waiting for his travel dates wouldn't have m=
attered=2C because your arrival date is different anyway.  I'm guessing tic=
kets were cheaper a few months ago when I first mentioned going there.  But=
 it's nice you're leaving together=2C and nice that you'll both be there at=
 Xmas.  Send me whatever you would have paid for your ticket had I not inte=
rfered=2C the rest is on my card anyway.  You say you're finding them for 6=
30?  Wow.  I searched pretty diligently=2C and 800 looked damn good=2C but =
you're much better at that than I am.  Where did you find such cheap ones? =
 I'll go there next time to search=2C then go to the airlines directly for =
the actual purchase.  =20
So you're right again=2C we're done with it and can forget it now=2C can't =
wait to see you!
I love you millions of times way beyond this=2C too=2C my darling angel.

They suck. It cost me $277 to change it - but here's my new itinerary. And =
the travel agency sucks too - there are still flights I can find online for=
 $630+=2C so screw them=2C and NEVER use a travel agent for mainland US tra=
vel=2C I just don't think it beats what you can find online. I know you sai=
d you aren't going to=2C but if you ever buy any tickets for me again (espe=
cially when I'm still supposed to be paying for it myself)=2C please PLEASE=
 call and confirm before you actually purchase it. Yes I wanted to be there=
 when Nick is there=2C but I also want to come earlier because it's so far =
and so expensive=2C and it's warm and beachy and vacation-y with you guys! =
I appreciate you taking the time to try and arrange this for me/for us=2C M=
om=2C I really do=2C thank you - but I didn't realize you were going to out=
right purchase. And I also really appreciate you helping me cover the loss =
on this too. Turns out to be ~$500 :( You're right=2C it's not the end of t=
he world=2C but it is like an entire different airline ticket! we can take =
it=2C I'm glad I don't have to do it all by myself=2C thank you. Also I'm g=
lad we're stressed about this now=2C because we wont be come Christmas time=
 when we're actually together!! I'll send you some money for the other tick=
et - $450? 500? And if anyone asks what I want for Christmas=2C say some mo=
ney towards my blessed airfare :P =20
=0A=

I love you way beyond all of this times a million <3=20
