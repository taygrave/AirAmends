  IMPORTANT CONSUMER NOTICES    *Incorporated Terms* - Your travel is
subject to United's Contract of Carriage terms. The Contract is available
for inspection at any UA ticketing facility, united.com
<http://www.united.com> or by calling 1-800-UNITED-1. Passengers have the
right to receive the full text of the terms incorporated by reference free
of charge by mail or other delivery service. The Contract terms include
rules about limits on liability for personal injury or death and for loss,
damage, or delay of goods and baggage, check-in times, overbooking,
security issues, reservations, denial of carriage, refunds, claims limits
and restrictions, including time limitations for filing a claim or lawsuit,
and schedule changes and irregularities. The Contract of Carriage
<http://www.united.com/travel/policies/contract/default.asp> contains
further detail of these terms.  *Additional Terms* - Depending on the rules
applicable to the fare paid, one or more restrictions including, but not
limited to one or more of the following, may apply to your travel: (1) the
ticket may not be refundable but may be exchangeable for a fee with another
restricted fare ticket meeting all the rules/restrictions of the original
ticket (including the payment of any difference in fares); (2) a fee may
apply for changing/canceling reservations; or (3) travel may be restricted
to specific flights and/or times and minimum and/or maximum stay may be
required.   *Baggage Liability* - On domestic flights, United's maximum
liability limit for checked baggage is $3400 USD per passenger and United
excludes liability for all unchecked baggage. For travel within the U.S.,
United excludes liability for fragile, valuable or perishable items carried
in all baggage including jewelry, computers, cash, camera equipment and
similar valuables. If any of these items are lost, damaged or delayed, you
will not be entitled to any reimbursement. You can declare excess valuation
on certain baggage at the airport, additional fees will apply.  *ADVICE TO
INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON CARRIER LIABILITY* - Passengers on a journey
involving an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the
country of departure are advised that international treaties known as the
Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including
its amendments, may apply to the entire journey, including any portion
thereof within a country. For such passengers, the treaty, including
special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs and
may limit the liability of the Carrier in respect of death of or injury to
passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for
delay of passengers and baggage.  *Notice--Overbooking of Flights* - Airline
flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will
not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If
there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other
persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few
exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in
deadline which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. *The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.*  *Personal Health*

serious condition called Deep Vein Thrombosis
