further detail of these terms.  *Additional
Terms* - Depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid, one or more
restrictions including, but not limited to one or more of the following,

valuable or perishable items carried in all baggage including jewelry,

ON CARRIER LIABILITY* =96 Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate
destination or stop in a country other than the country of departure are
advised that international treaties known as the Montreal Convention, or
its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including its amendments, may apply
to the entire journey, including any portion thereof within a country. For
such passengers, the treaty, including special contracts of carriage
embodied in applicable tariffs, governs and may limit the liability of the
Carrier in respect of death of or injury to passengers, and for destruction
or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and
baggage.  *Notice=97Overbooking
of Flights* - Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight
chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has
a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied
a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up
their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing.
If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other
persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few
exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in
deadline which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. *The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.*  *Personal
