ADVICE TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
Where a passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or a stop in a
country other than the country of departure, either the Warsaw Convention
and the Hague Protocol, their amendments, and any special contracts of
carriage embodied in applicable tariffs that waive Warsaw/Hague limits, or
the Montreal Convention may apply to the entire journey including the
portion within the countries of departure or destination and, in some
cases, may limit the liability of the carrier for death or personal injury,
delay, and for loss of or damage to baggage. The Montreal Convention, where
applicable, does not impose, and special contracts voluntarily entered into
by many carriers, including JetBlue, waive, the Warsaw/Hague limitations
for compensatory damages arising out of personal injury or wrongful death
caused by an accident, as defined by the applicable treaty. The names of
carriers party to the special contracts are available at all ticket offices
of such carriers and may be examined upon request.

NOTICE OF BAGGAGE LIABILITY LIMITS
For international transportation (including domestic portions) governed by
the Montreal Convention, JetBlue's liability for baggage is limited to
1,131 SDRs (see, http://www.imf.org for current value) per passenger unless
a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. For international
transportation governed by the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol and
their amendments, JetBlue's liability for baggage is limited to $9.07 per
pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage
unless a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. Special
rules may apply to valuable articles. For domestic transportation,
JetBlue's liability for baggage is limited to $3,300 per passenger. General
baggage rules: As set forth more fully in its Contract of Carriage and
international passenger rules tariffs, JetBlue will not be responsible for
fragile or perishable goods. JetBlue assumes no liability for oversized,
overweight or overpacked baggage, or for loss of or damage to baggage parts
such as wheels, straps, pockets, pull handles, zippers, hanger hooks or
other items attached to baggage. JetBlue will not be responsible for the
following items in checked or unchecked baggage: money, jewelry including
watches, cameras, camcorders, any type of electronic equipment, including
computers, valuable papers or documents and other similar items as
described in more detail in the Contract of Carriage.

NOTICE OF OVERBOOKING OF FLIGHTS
Although JetBlue does not intentionally overbook its flights, there is a
slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a
person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one
will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers
willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the
airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, JetBlue will deny
boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding
priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with JetBlue's
check-in deadline (which are available upon request from JetBlue), persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and JetBlue's boarding priorities are
available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some
airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some
foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available.
Check with your airline or your travel agent.
