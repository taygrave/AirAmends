s
further detail of these terms.
*Additional Terms* - Depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid,
one or more restrictions including, but not limited to one or more of the
following, may apply to your travel: (1) the ticket may not be refundable
but may be exchangeable for a fee with another restricted fare ticket

INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS ON CARRIER LIABILITY* =96 Passengers on a journey
involving an ultimate destination or stop in a country other than the
country of departure are advised that international treaties known as the
Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including
its amendments, may apply to the entire journey, including any portion
thereof within a country. For such passengers, the treaty, including
special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs and
may limit the liability of the Carrier in respect of death of or injury to
passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for
delay of passengers and baggage.  *Notice=97Overbooking of Flights* - Airli=
ne
flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will
not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed
reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If
there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other
persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few
exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in
deadline which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons
denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. *The complete
rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding
priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding
locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel
from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be
available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.*  *Personal
