NEXT STEPS
    flight tables sort and display by date
    turn airport list into javacript object for form validation
    Flight buttons:
        add new - search and add only after date of your last flight
        turn from buttons into ajax requests auto-updating page
    have flight reports return order by / sort by
    HAve a dashboard of (# flight emails, # flight legs total, # deleted, # added)
    Pop ups to let user know website is working but busy:
        when waiitng on gmail api
        initial query
        reset from scratch query

Non-prioritized TIDYING:
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    why back doesn't report acurate numbers, needs to be refreshed
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    Tidying up code
    make flight parsing faster
    Adding in tests
    LOOKING GOOD - Better design
