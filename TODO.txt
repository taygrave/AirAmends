NEXT STEPS
    Change emissions and $ formatting to be done behind the scences (with rounding) as early as possible and then calculate table totals onready in html 
    Flight buttons:
        add new - search and add only after date of your last flight
        turn from buttons into ajax requests auto-updating page
    Allow user to add flights
    have flight reports return order by / sort by
    HAve a dashboard of (# flight emails, # flight legs total, # deleted, # added)
    Pop ups to let user know website is working but busy:
        when waiitng on gmail api
        initial query
        reset from scratch query

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    Tidying up code
    make flight parsing faster
    Adding in tests
    LOOKING GOOD - Better design
