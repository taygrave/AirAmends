CODE TIDYING:
    remove model.connect where possible
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

PAGE STYLING:
    make sure flight add / delete buttons fit in page
    modal on calc methods display needs to be widened
    Make form look nicer
    donation page

Things I want help from Mentors with:
    adding in tests
    redrawing the map on click of a button
    if logged out - 'authorize google' still tries to sign in the last person
