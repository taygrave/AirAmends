BUGS:
    deleteFlights not working NaN error
    issue with data deletion on signout
    address scenario where you don't have any email finds (suggest reasons why this may have happened)
    if logged out - 'authorize google' still tries to sign in the last person

CODE TIDYING:
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

PAGE STYLING:
    make sure flight add / delete buttons fit in page
    why does it scroll right/left? eliminate this
    modal on calc methods display needs to be widened
    Make form look nicer
    donation page

Things I want help from Mentors with:
    adding in tests
    redrawing the map on click of a button

New Features:
    allow people to add in their own flights sans gmail account
