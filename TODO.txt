FOR AJAX REDESIGN:
    In a certain div - 
        Bind click events on A tags
        get their href (where they WERE going)
        then get that yourself with ajax
        prevent default redirection
        instead load the rendered in div
    if event handlers do not work:
        need to re-bind onto the parent element so that javascript table stuff still works in new layout (delete / add flight buttons and functionality)


NEXT STEPS
    Add donation button
    turn airport list into javacript object for form validation
    HAve a dashboard of (# flight emails, # flight legs total, # deleted, # added)
    Pop ups to let user know website is working but busy:
        when waiitng on gmail api
        initial query
        reset from scratch query

Non-prioritized TIDYING:
    have // replace all http and https sources
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    why back doesn't report acurate numbers, needs to be refreshed
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    Tidying up code
    make flight parsing faster
    Adding in tests
    LOOKING GOOD - Better design

TABLED:
    Adding new flights feature
