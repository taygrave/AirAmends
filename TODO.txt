NEXT STEPS
    Take form out of table
    Have a dashboard of (# flight emails, # flight legs total, # deleted, # added)
    Add donation button
    Demo feature for those who can't/don't want to sign in

Non-prioritized TIDYING:
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    why back doesn't report acurate numbers, needs to be refreshed
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    Tidying up code
    make flight parsing faster
    Adding in tests
    LOOKING GOOD - Better design

TABLED:
    Adding new flights feature
