NEXT STEPS
    javascript dashboard setup math is acting super weird >:C
    Do not save flights where depart and arrive city are the same
    airport suggestion input box delayed
    Why not animating on sign in, how to fix
    redraw button?
    Have a dashboard of (# flight emails, # flight legs total, # deleted, # added)
    Add donation button
    Demo feature for those who can't/don't want to sign in

Non-prioritized TIDYING:
    alphabetize airports on drop down for add flight
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    why back doesn't report acurate numbers, needs to be refreshed
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    adding in tests?

Styling:
    why does it scroll right/left? eliminate this
    carbon calcs display needs to be widened
    put "how we calculate" link on the bottom, make it look nicer
    Take form out of table?

TABLED:
    Adding new flights feature
