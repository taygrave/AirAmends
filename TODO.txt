NEXT STEPS
    need to re-setup id 0 for demo abilities
    javascript dashboard setup math is acting super weird >:C
    alphabetize airports on drop down for add flight
    redraw button? maybe having to do with g vars if user logged in?
    rethink reset meaning
    demo button not requiring gmail querying (using set data in db)

Non-prioritized TIDYING:
    remove model.connect where possible
    find all FIXMEs
    find all TODOs
    change 'session' in airamends.py to explicitly refer to db session

Things I want help from Mentors for:
    adding in tests?

Styling:
    make sure flight add / delete buttons fit in page
    why does it scroll right/left? eliminate this
    modal on calc methods display needs to be widened
    Make form look nicer
    donation page

TABLED:
    Querying for new flights beyond what you have in the db
    Demo feature for those who can't/don't want to sign in
