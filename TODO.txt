NEXT STEPS
    find out why United airlines emails aren't being decoded
    write out possible combinations (with a smaller sample) and find the pattern to identify distinct flights
    remove double segments from the same email (unless a reason not to?)
    find flight date
    find out confirmation number (to ensure no double segments, is this trouble anyway?)
    Figure out how to get only MY itineraries:
        look at who from (domain matching airline) - or better yet, look at who to, then see if user's name appears elsewhere in the email (like as the ticketed passenger) and if not, may not be their flight
    

Once flights figured out:
    how to calculate distance
    how to calculate carbon


Non-prioritized problems:
    Where's my icelandair flight...
